# DecisionTree_RandomForest
R implementation of Decision Tree (Classification) and Random Forest
This Implementation uses Ionosphere dataset from mlbench package.
This radar data was collected by a system in Goose Bay, Labrador. This system consists of a phased
array of 16 high-frequency antennas with a total transmitted power on the order of 6.4 kilowatts.
See the paper for more details.  The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.  "good" radar
returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere.  "bad" returns are
those that do not; their signals pass through the ionosphere.
It has 351 observations with 35 variables.
